DESCRIPTION OF GAME

Game title: Shape Shifter

Game description: In this game the player controls a ship 
and must avoid asteroids for as long as possible. The 
player wins points by time, that is, the longer the
player avoids asteroids the higher the score. Obvoiusly,
if the player crashes the ship with one of the asteroids
the game comes to an end; game over.

Game mechanics: The reason the game is called Shape 
Shifter is because the ship can change shape if it hits
the edges of the screen. For example, if the player 
makes the ship hit the left and right edges of the screen
all pieces of the ship will merge together and reduce its 
hitbox. However, just like the hitbox can be reduced, it 
can be expanded by hitting the top and bottom edges of 
the screen.
